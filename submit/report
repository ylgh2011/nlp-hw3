# Overal desciption

Our algorithm can be summarized as IBM model 2 with bidirection, intersection and diagonal heuristic operation



# IBM Model 2




# Bidirection

While using IBM model 2 to update the dictionary Pr(f | e) (probability of a Franch word given an English word), we maintain another dictionary Pr(e | f) (probability of an English word given a Franch word) at the same time.

After the training phase (several iterations), the alignment between a pair of words (f_i, e_j) is decided by the product of Pr( f_i | e_j ) and Pr( e_j | f_i ) instead of a single probability.



# Intersection

A pair of words will be decided as an alignment only if it is in the intersection set of alignment set of Franch given English and alignment set of English given Franch.

instance:
For one pair of sentences [1 2 3] [1 2 3], we have two alignments:
1) alignment set of Franch given English: [1-3 2-2 3-1]
2) alignment set of English given Franch: [3-3 2-2 3-1]
In this case, only 2-2 will be chosen.



# Diagonal heuristic

This operation is performed after intersection.
For any pair of words (f_i, e_i) that have the same index in a pair of sentences, make them as an alignment if f_i is not aligned to other words.

instance:
   1   2   3   4
1  ()
2  *
3          ()
4              ()
Aligned the diagonal word pairs if that row is not chosen.
In this case that would be [1-1], [3-3], [4-4]
